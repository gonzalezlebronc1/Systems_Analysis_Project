CPS 310 - Phase 1 - System Overview & Use Cases

**1. Introduction**

	a. Purpose

	This document outlines the system analysis for a university process management system. The goal is to improved
	system tasks such as applying to the university, scheduling classes, withdrawing from a class, final grade submission, changing majors, viewing transcripts, and graduation.

	b. Scope

	This document covers the first analysis phase, including system requirements, context diagrams, and use case definitions. 

	c. Definitions & Acronyms

	* DFD: Data Flow Diagram

	* ERD: Entity Relationship Diagram

	* Use Case: A model of the system and how user interactions with the system

	d. References

	* University of Dayton system requirements

	e. Overview

	The document will provide an overview of the environment that this system must operate within,
	including other software and hardware systems that will interface with this system. An overview of the features to be provided by the software.
	Description of the types of users that will interact with this software and assumed properties of those users. Any constraints that have been placed on the project 
	(that are not, in themselves, requirements). Any assumptions that are being made in specifying these requirements.
