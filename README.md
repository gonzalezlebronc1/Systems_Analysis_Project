CPS 310 - Phase 1 - System Overview & Use Cases

**1. Introduction**

 a. Purpose:  
	This document outlines the system analysis for a university process management system. The goal is to improved
	system tasks such as applying to the university, scheduling classes, withdrawing from a class, final grade submission, changing majors, viewing transcripts, and graduation.

 b. Scope:  
	This document covers the first analysis phase, including system requirements, context diagrams, and use case definitions. 

 c. Definitions & Acronyms:
		*DFD: Data Flow Diagram*  
			A data flow diagram (DFD) is a graphical representation that visually depicts how data moves through a system or process, illustrating the flow of information from its source to its destination, 
			including where it is stored and how it is transformed along the way, using standardized symbols to represent different elements like processes, data stores, and external entities.  
		*ERD: Entity Relationship Diagram*  
			An entity relationship diagram (ERD) is a visual representation that shows how different entities (people, objects, or concepts) relate to each other within a system.  
		*Use Case Diagram: A model of the system and how user interactions with the system*  
			A use case diagram is a visual representation of how users (called "actors") interact with a system, highlighting the different functionalities and goals they can achieve within that system.

 e. Overview:
	The document will provide an overview of the environment that this system must operate within,
	including other software and hardware systems that will interface with this system. An overview of the features to be provided by the software.
	Description of the types of users that will interact with this software and assumed properties of those users. Any constraints that have been placed on the project 
	(that are not, in themselves, requirements). Any assumptions that are being made in specifying these requirements.



**2. Overall Description**

 *a. Product Perspective
 	The system's goal is to interface with the student management and university databases that are currently in place. It will act as a focal point for managing administrative procedures for students.  
 *b. Product Functions
	-*applying to the university*
	-*scheduling classes*
	-*withdrawing from a class* 
	-*final class grade submission*
	-*changing your major* 
	-*viewing your transcript*
	-*graduation process*
	-*dropping out of the university*

 *c. User Characteristics:
	*Students:* Primary users interacting with the system for academic management
	*Administrators:* Manage student records and approve requests
	*Professors:* Submit final grades

 *d. Constraints:
		-Web-based with mobile compatibility  
 *e. Assumptions:
		-Users have basic technical proficiency
		-University maintains up-to-date records
